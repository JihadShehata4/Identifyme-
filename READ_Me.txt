This is a software of fingerprint biometrics identification system.(identify me ^_^)

you enter your desired fingerprint image to be matched against pre-stored templates using sift detector and descriptor.

We use 500 fingerprint images as templates, located in 'train_real' folder.
In 'test_altered' folder, there are some images to use as test ones.
